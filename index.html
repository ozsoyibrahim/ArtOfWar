            <h1>HANNIBAL'S WAR ART</h1>
            <P>Hannibal usually went for the unpredictable surprise maneuver that had never been seen before, including
                crossing the Alps in winter and forcing the Romans to fight in the dead of winter and at night.</P>

            <p>WHO IS HANNIBAL?</p>
            <h1>THE GREATEST MILITARY STRATEGIST</h1>
            <P>Hannibal was one of the sons of Hamilcar Barca, a Carthaginian leader, and an unknown mother.
                He was born in what is present-day northern Tunisia, one of many Mediterranean regions colonised
                by the Canaanites from their homelands in Phoenicia, a region corresponding with the Mediterranean
                coasts of modern Lebanon and Syria. He had several sisters whose names are unknown, and two brothers,
                Hasdrubal and Mago. His brothers-in-law were Hasdrubal the Fair and the Numidian king Naravas.
                He was still a child when his sisters married, and his brothers-in-law were close associates during
                his father's struggles in the Mercenary War and the Punic conquest of the <span>Iberian
                    Peninsula.</span></P>

                <h1>MORALE</h1>
                <P>Hannibal studied his opponents very carefully,
                    employing every means of gathering intelligence
                    in enemy camps, including spies from allied
                    populations who provisioned the Romans.</P>

            </div>
            <div class="box">
                <h1>DIVERSION</h1>
                <P>When necessary, Hannibal paid for credible intelligence
                    with silver supplied from mines in Carthaginian Spain;
                    as long as that silver lasted to pay for good intel,
                    he was unbeatable.</P>

            <div class="box">
                <h1>FOCUS</h1>
                <P>Hannibal annihilated the Romans on the days when fools
                    were the supposed commanders.</P>

            <div class="box">
                <h1>DON'T CUT CORNERS</h1>
                <P>Hannibal proved it’s not the size of your army but how well
                    prepared it is. He epitomizes the old adage, “Better 10 men
                    wisely led than 100 with a fool at the head.”</P>

            <div class="box">
                <h1>ATTACK FROM ALL SOURCES</h1>
                <P>Hannibal sagely exploited the 2-consul Roman alternating
                    command rotated one day between an experienced military
                    veteran and the next day with a political appointee
                    populist leading. On at least three occasions, Hannibal
                    annihilated the Romans on the days when fools were the
                    supposed commanders.</P>
